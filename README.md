### What does it look like ?

### Scala versions

2.10.x, 2.9.3, 2.9.2 and 2.9.1.

Install
-------

### Add the plugin to your build with the following in project/build.sbt:

    addSbtPlugin("com.sqality.scct" % "sbt-scct" % "0.2.1")

#### Or you can use the last Snapshot instead

    resolvers += "Sonatype OSS Snapshots" at "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots"
    addSbtPlugin("com.sqality.scct" % "sbt-scct" % "0.3-SNAPSHOT")

### Add the plugin settings to your project, at build.sbt:

    ScctPlugin.instrumentSettings

### Run your unit tests :

    $ sbt clean scct:test

Then open:

    ./target/scala_2.9.2/coverage-report/index.html

### Multiproject builds

Add the plugin instrumentation settings to child projects and the report
merging settings to the parent project.\
For example project/MyBuild.scala:

    object MyBuild extends Build {
      lazy val root = Project(id = "parent", base = file("."))
          settings (ScctPlugin.mergeReportSettings: _*) aggregate(first, second)

      lazy val firstChild = Project(id = "firstchild", base = file("first"))
          settings (ScctPlugin.instrumentSettings: _*)

      lazy val secondChild = Project(id = "secondchild", base = file("second"))
          settings (ScctPlugin.instrumentSettings: _*)
    }

Run coverage for all child projects with:

    $ sbt clean scct:test

This creates individual coverage reports into
\$childProjectDir/target/scala*<ver>/coverage-report/\
Merge all the existing child reports into
\$parentProjectDir/target/scala*<ver>/coverage-report/ with:

    $ sbt scct-merge-report
